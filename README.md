# QI Dashboard Backend Demo

This repository contains a prototype of the backend service meant to be used to demo the QI Dashboard. 

## Requirements

You will need to:

* Meet some basic [Vagrant requirements](https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments/#requirements)

* [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and provide it in your ``provisioning/secrets.yml`` file. No scopes need to be selected on the token generation page.

## Getting started

Typing ``vagrant up`` will download a [CentOS 7 VM](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/inclusivedesign/boxes/centos7) and deploy the service.
